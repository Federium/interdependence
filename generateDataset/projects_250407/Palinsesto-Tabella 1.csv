Some call it entanglement, but here, it’s just a game—you’re about to step inside. “Somewhere, Between” is a participatory audio-visual performance where audience and performers blur together, boundaries fade, and opposites reveal themselves to be inextricably intertwined in a co-becoming entanglement. The performance, produced by Campo Teatrale for the event INTERDEPENDENCE, is conceived and created by Usine Baug in collaboration with Pietro Francesco Pingitore (visual artist) and Matrix (New Media Artist – Interactive Sound & Visuals).

lunedì, aprile 7;18:00 - 21:00;The INDIVIDUAL/COLLECTIVE dimension of sustainable communication;Selling sustainability' means finding the right balance between two apparent polarities: promoting long-term, collective 'planetary' well-being and highlighting the immediate, concrete, and personal benefits for 'consumers'. Focusing exclusively on one side risks relegating sustainable initiatives to a niche or diluting their broader impact. The goal, then, is to integrate both perspectives, creating a narrative that appeals to personal motivations while fostering a collective commitment to sustainability.
