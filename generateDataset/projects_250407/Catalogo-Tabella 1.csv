The project focuses on repurposing the remnants of buildings bombed in 1944 consisting essentially exterior walls, one made of dolomite and the other of red brick, that were adapted for economic use in the post-war period, according to available resources. The sheds have now outlived their purpose, and the time has come to restore one of them to a residential function, while the other is to be introduced to that role. The study of construction materials, clay and dolomite, evolved into two interior concepts: Clay and Dolomite. The Clay plans to restore the shed’s residential function by creating two 34.5 m² rental apartments, while the Dolomite building will host a “holiday home” for families, with four levels for four people, resulting in s a space where communal living coexists with individual autonomy.;;Ieva Skuja-Zelča;Andra Šmite;https://www.fold.lv/en/2024/07/design-graduates-ieva-skuja-zelca/;;;;;;

When barriers seem insurmountable, it might be just a small detail the one that allows you to go beyond. Such a small but game changing detail takes the shape of a refined play of joints combined with the lightness of the painted rice paper without any interference and with no aids, compose the main structure of the installation, leveraging one of the most archaic construction systems: the wedge.

Physically, YORIGOKORO presents as a coffer where people can store items that will serve as a source of emotional comfort, when the mind is too tired to move. It also provides a sense of security, telling users that their item “is here, so I'll be okay” even when not in use. YORIGOKORO materializes the sense of security and comfort through “safe objects” and the ritual action of opening and closing the box, which encourages a change of mindset in the user.;;Sara Nakano;Yasuyuki Hirai;;YES;;file;;;

The expression “distortion of language” loses its meaning, because language is alive, metaphorical and fragile, it can react quickly to environmental changes and becoming the best means of communication. Nonetheless, the lack of a common understanding of language can lead to a feeling of alienation and disconnection. Within this context, Slänger started out of a desire to clarify slang, but also to effectively introduce it to a larger audience. To achieve this goal, it introduces modern Estonian slang in a calendar format that promotes learning new words – one word a week and space to reflect. The form of the calendar removes the formalities of a classic dictionary and provides visual support for the humour and playfulness of slang. Without diving deep into the history, rules nor definitions, Slänger encourages us to communicate through finding common ground.;;Ljubov Terukova;Ott Kagovere, Alexandra Margetic;;;;;;;

Discarded plastic materials become the inspiration to design something “made to be made again”. Closeloop creates a collection of accessories using circular, cheerful and dynamic shapes starting from childhood objects and toys. Leveraging 3D printing and attentive research on conscious materials, the products are easily recyclable as they are made from a singular material. The project revolves around the concept of connection, which is expressed through the shapes of the accessories, the connection between past and present behind the concept (childhood toys becoming adult accessories, as well as that of present and future state of the materials (recycling). ;;Sara Tridente;Alba Cappellieri, Francesco Ballestrazzi, Andrea Della Vecchia, Livia Tenuta;https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-oZ6y8EaCk550U1aQaRVt5Xs-w0iBUI/view?usp=share_link;;;;;;

Tete Ya Mama was born from the desire to use 3D printing to solve real-world problems, particularly in less developed contexts and emerging countries. The identified opportunity was addressing congenital malformations, specifically cleft palates, a condition that hinders breastfeeding and can cause malnutrition, particularly in African countries. This led to the creation of Tete Ya Mama, a 3D printed device that facilitates breastfeeding, making it safer and more effective. The device is digitally modeled and printed as needed, ensuring resource access to everyone in need and demonstrating how innovation can address major global challenges starting from a more specific topic or need.;;Anna Maria Cabini, Viola Cucchi, Anna Ingaramo, Marco Poggianti, Greta Tassi;Francesco Zurlo, Barbara Del Curto, Alessandro Perrone;;;;;;;
