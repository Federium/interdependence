Prostheses can help them to live more independent, healthy and active lives and lets them be part of the society with lesser limitations. However, access to these devices is extremely limited, and even when they are accessible, prostheses are often NOt accepted. The industry today focuses on high-tech products, while simpler, more affordable solutions are being mostly neglected. In this project, I tried finding ways to improve accessibility, functionality and acceptance. I did this in close collaboration with users, stakeholders and my collaborating partner Agile Robots. The final concept combines advantages of both electric and mechanical prostheses in a low-cost, open source design. It allows for ergoNOmical, functional and aesthetic customization based on the users’ individual needs and desires. This process is facilitated by leveraging techNOlogies such as 3D-printing to reduce cost and manual work effort.;https://www.umu.se/en/umea-institute-of-design/education/student-work/masters-programme-in-advanced-product-design/2024/heinrich-zaunschirm/;Master's Programme in Advanced Product Design;Graduation Project;2024;Heinrich Zaunschirm;Lee Brunco, Arleigh Parr, Gracie Meek, Julia Kan;;

It can be adapted to VR headsets and other extended reality devices, providing virtual reality interactions that go beyond visual experiences, with a haptic resolution of up to 1mm. The product has broad practical value in fields such as experience, gaming, and medical applications.
B. VirtX-Tac Haptic Interface Module
This can be understood as a plug-and-play ""haptic screen,"" designed to be developer/designer-friendly. Once connected to a computer and paired with module software and hardware for debugging, it can easily develop various virtual haptic patterns.

In contemporary Japan, technology and views of life and death have become incompatible.
In addition, with the development of generative AI technology, it is beginning to happen that the dead can be brought back to life by technology, regardless of their will. The majority of the living no longer have rights over the dead, and society is heading toward dystopia.
 Therefore, using speculative design, we speculated on a desirable life-afterlife for the future formation of an AI society.
 As a scenario, we set up a future society in which unwanted resurrections occur, and created a dystopian image of the dead in an elevator.To avoid this, we proposed “A-Life,” a platform for realizing a better life-afterlife. We produced a device for both the dead and the living to meet face to face in the way they desire.
 Based on these proposals, workshops were held for citizens at the temple. Speculation about the future was conducted, and sympathy for the activities of “A-Life” by the priests was obtained.";;Industrial Design Course;;2024;Sachika Kiyama, Yutaro Miyake, Sara Nakano;Yasuyuki Hirai;;

Our challenge was to design something that could help children with disabilities in their development and growth phase, but at the same time be playful, accessible and educational. The mission of our project is therefore to improve conditions for visually impaired children in families with economic difficulties. Sight is an extremely important element for learning and development, in fact it is very important that children have eye examinations to detect any problems. But why not make this more fun, affordable and accessible? 

PROJECT EXPLANATION: 
Vision Crafters is a DIY glasses kit paired with an app, designed to help low-income families determine if their children may need support or be at risk for visual impairment. The experience is built around an interactive and engaging learning approach that empowers users with knowledge and awareness. Guided by the FOR-FEW / FOR-ALL principle, Vision Crafters seeks to prevent and address visual impairments through an inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly experience. By combining hands-on activities with affordable materials, Vision Crafters transforms visual education into a playful and enriching journey. More than just a toy, but a way to ‘see’ disability as a resource and not as a limitation to society, ensuring that awareness and knowledge are not the preserve of a few but an opportunity for all.";;Specializing Master in Design for Kids & Toys;Master specializzante;2024/2025;Lee Brunco, Arleigh Parr, Gracie Meek, Julia Kan;Lee Brunco, Arleigh Parr, Gracie Meek, Julia Kan;;
