Designed in collaboration with the Estonian Ministry of Finance, this project aims to make the Estonian state budget more accessible and understandable through an interactive dashboard. Based on stakeholder interviews and an iterative design process, the project resulted in a budget visualization that makes complex financial data more accessible. The dashboard helps users easily explore how state funds are allocated, showing connections between outcome areas, activities, institutions, resources, and metrics. It promotes transparency and a deeper understanding of the budget's workings for politicians, analysts, journalists, and citizens. Making budget data more accessible, ultimately fosters more informed democratic discussion and encourages public engagement with government actions.
