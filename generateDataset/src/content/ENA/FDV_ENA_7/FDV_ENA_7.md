PillEase is a multifunctional device designed to assist individuals with limited hand strength, including the elderly and those with conditions such as arthritis and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, in opening child-resistant pill bottles. Its ergonomic design minimizes hand strain, while an integrated pill cutter allows for precise dosage adjustments. Additionally, a built-in storage compartment provides convenient pill organisation. By addressing common challenges in medication management, PillEase enhances accessibility and ease of use in daily routines.
