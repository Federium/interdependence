Riva reimagines the home kettle by combining cutting-edge design, technological innovation, and user-centric functionality. Designed for cooking enthusiasts, Riva minimizes user actions, provides precise temperature control for various hot beverages, and serves as an aesthetic statement in the kitchen. It revolutionizes the water-boiling experience with an innovative flow management system: thanks to the lidâ€™s convergent shape, water is optimally directed into the kettle body, ensuring efficiency and ease of use. The lid features an automatic valve that opens with water pressure, eliminating the need to lift the cover manually and regulate the water flows inside the kettle, ensuring both efficiency and safety. With its ergonomic design and intuitive interface featuring temperature presets, Riva offers a precise and effortless user experience.
