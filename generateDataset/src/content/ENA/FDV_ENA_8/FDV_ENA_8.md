Amputees are often excluded and isolated due to bodily limitations and societal stigma. Prostheses can help them to live more independent, healthy and active lives and lets them be part of the society with lesser limitations. However, access to these devices is extremely limited, and even when they are accessible, prostheses are often not well accepted. The industry today focuses on high-tech products, while simpler, more affordable solutions are being mostly neglected. PAL focuses on ways to improve accessibility, functionality and acceptance. Designed in close collaboration with users, stakeholders and the company Agile Robots, the product combines advantages of both electric and mechanical prostheses in a low-cost, open-source and 3D-printable design. It allows for ergonomical, functional and aesthetic customization based on the users’ individual needs and desires.
