Courage is RESILIENCE is designed to transform the abstract concept of courage into a tangible environment. Created at the interaction between mental and physical realms, this installation evokes two distinct perceptions: from the outside, it appears as an obscure enclosed area, while from the inside, it surrounds visitors with a nature-inspired setting that unfolds through personal engagement. In an attempt to find order within chaos, the design merges regular geometric forms with erratic wood branches, creating a captivating and immersive experience.
