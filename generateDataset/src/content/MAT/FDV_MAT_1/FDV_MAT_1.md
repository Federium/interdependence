Alphablocs is an educational object for children aged 5-6. Made from two simple yet versatile shapes, obtained from recycled wood panel offcuts, it helps children learn to write letters and numbers turning children’s thoughts into tangible creations. By shaping and assembling forms, kids can explore meaningful links between mind and matter in a playful, enriching way, while fostering creativity through free play, self-expression, and discovery.
