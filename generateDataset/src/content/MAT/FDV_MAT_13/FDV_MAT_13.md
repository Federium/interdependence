The aim of this project is to inspire a reflection about how circular design can help the fashion and industry find new ways of transforming itself in a sustainable way, through a playful, dynamic use of aesthetics and communication. Discarded plastic materials become the inspiration to design something “made to be made again”. Closeloop creates a collection of accessories using circular, cheerful and dynamic shapes starting from childhood objects and toys. Leveraging 3D printing and attentive research on conscious materials, the products are easily recyclable as they are made from a singular material. The project revolves around the concept of connection, which is expressed through the shapes of the accessories, the connection between past and present behind the concept (childhood toys becoming adult accessories, as well as that of present and future state of the materials (recycling).
