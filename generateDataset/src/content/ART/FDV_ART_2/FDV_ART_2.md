Rapid Autografting explores a reality where biotechnological processes and body-hacking have evolved, and individuals customize their physiology to meet specific and temporary needs. Drawing on principles from design ecologies and design fiction, it speculates on the transformative potential of biotechnological advancements and the integration of biotechnology into sports footwear. This investigation materializes in possibility of a growing ability to control human’s biological conditions. The wearer’s own biomaterials are processed through advanced tissue engineering to improve customization and performance. In this application, the concept redefines long-distance running by creating an intimate, bioengineered bond between footwear and feet, tying together natural materials and artificial processes.
