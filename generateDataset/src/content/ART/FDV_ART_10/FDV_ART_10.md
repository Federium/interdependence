Materials surpass planetary boundaries, whose extractive nature even today raises critical ecological concerns. CROP-ED tackles one such challenge of managing agricultural waste, a major contributor to air pollution and CO₂ emissions by transforming them into biogenic building materials. This initiative mitigates environmental damage while fostering social equity through collective measures. By integrating carbon-sequestering materials into construction, our proposal envisions a circular system that reduces pollution, empowers farmers, and redefines waste management in developing regions.
