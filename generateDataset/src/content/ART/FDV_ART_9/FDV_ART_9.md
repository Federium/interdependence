In contemporary Japan, technology and views of life and death have become incompatible. With the development of generative AI technology, it is beginning to happen that the dead can be brought back to life by technology, regardless of their will. In a scenario where unwanted resurrections occurs, A-Life explores through speculative design a desirable life. The project consists of a platform where both the dead and the living can meet face to face in the way they desire.
