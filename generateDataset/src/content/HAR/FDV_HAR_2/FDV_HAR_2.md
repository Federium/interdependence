Courage is BREAKING THE BARRIERS investigates barriers as sources of ambiguous attraction, tangling between the fear of pushing beyond them and the unrestrained desire of going further. In front of physical or mental barriers, the unknown and the desire to understand what goes beyond the immediate understanding raises a deep emotional response, often ambivalent. When barriers seem insurmountable, it might be just a small detail the one that allows you to go beyond. Such a small but game changing detail takes the shape of a refined play of joints combined with the lightness of the painted rice paper without any interference and with no aids, compose the main structure of the installation, leveraging one of the most archaic construction systems: the wedge. An act of courage is needed to unveil what’s beyond the barrier. One needs to bow, entering in a reserved and gathered dimension where a measured structure helps face adversity and four paper-thin suspended barriers protect and guide the visitor towards a bright monolith, accompanied by reasoned yet imprecise lines.
