The identity of the Politecnico is key to defining the campus and conveying its values. Nonetheless, the identity of the students who spend their days on campus doesn't always match it. A-LIGN proposes a re-desgn of Politecnico's spaces in such a way that inspires  students and connects them with each other and their university, bringing together the different identities (the institutional one and that of its students) in an engaging end dynamic academic environment where both can respectfully coexist.
