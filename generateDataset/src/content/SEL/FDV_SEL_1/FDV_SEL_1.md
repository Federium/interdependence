Buzz Beyond Borders amplifies the unheard voices of 39,600 transborder students who navigate daily crossings between Mexico and the U.S. for their K through college education. Rooted in collaborative storytelling, this initiative uses a simple yet transformative tool, a phone, to document and share stories, fostering solidarity and understanding across boundaries. These iterative exchanges cultivate a community where students, families, and educators shape collective imagination and extend resources. Created by transborder students themselves, the initiative aims to reach policymakers to drive meaningful change.
