"A shift in perspective to a nature-centered approach: we have a conviction this is the key for the symbiotic future between nature and humanity. This project is inspired by Mandala, the diagram of harmony among various beings. At this year's Osaka Expo, we plan to exhibit this work incorporating traditional craftsmanship and wishes of children for the future. And the fragrance based on the legends about the lotuses and roses will be added to this. This is composed of altruistic behavior toward each other."
