"AI is striving to bridge the gap, yet it has not yet reached a level of development capable of bringing significant improvements to our daily lives at least not in the way biological intelligence already does in crucial fields such as nutrition, protection, and mobility. The so-called ""Datacene"" era is still far from becoming a reality, and this is not merely due to the relatively small amount of stored data that AI processes to learn. Territories within these blurred areas represent a stimulating theme for design and technology-related investigations. Super-humans II gives shape to a conversation that happened over a period of six months, born from a brainstorming and nature-exploration session with students in the natural reserve of Nida, on the Curonian Lagoon and later shared with generative parametric design software through prompting and iterations."
