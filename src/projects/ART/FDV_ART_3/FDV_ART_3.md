Designing for Death in a Divided Future explores possible future death rites amidst a climate crisis. In two scenarios, the tenets of two different societies have shaped two very different ways of approaching life and death. In the first scenario, “Gaian Sympoiesis”, a full-scale body urn brings the body back to the soil to eventually decompose and re-integrate into ecological flows. The cycles of life guide the principles of this proposal, offering a material reincarnation.  In the second scenario, “Cybernetic Ascendancy”, a lifetime of a person’s digital footprint has been collected, removed, and compressed into a crystal orb. This artefact exemplifies the ideology of the mind capturing the essence of a human.
