MyOceanEye is a DIY floating camera that captures underwater images and live-streams them to your phone. Your photos help train AI to recognize marine life and debris, turning your exploration into valuable data for ocean scientists and ocean cleanup projects. The camera’s simple design means anyone – from families to schools - can assemble it using everyday items like a Raspberry Pi, a fisheye camera, and a waterproof container. MyOceanEye combines technology (AI, Raspberry Pi) with nature (ocean) to enhance human understanding of marine ecosystems, demonstrating how artificial tools can coexist with and in support of natural systems.
