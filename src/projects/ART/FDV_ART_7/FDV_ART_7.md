Wormhole Museum Experience transforms the visitor journey at the Como Silk Museum by seamlessly integrating heritage and digital technologies. Responding to challenges such as the conventional museum guestbook and the limited inclusivity of the museum gift shop, the project introduces a mobile application that allows visitors to collect digital artifacts as they explore the museum. At the end of their visit, a multitouch screen wall provides an engaging opportunity to interact collectively with the artifacts created from their digital journey, bringing together diverse individual experiences made in real life through digital environments.
