AURITA is an intelligent bionic cyanobacteria-cleaning robot. Using a self-suction aquatic cleaning device as its template, the robot mimics the pulsating bell-shaped movements of a jellyfish, creating vortices that enable the collection and storage of algae from the water's surface. This bionic propulsion is specifically tailored for shallow water bodies, ensuring minimal energy consumption and environmental disruption during cleaning and recovery tasks. Powered by solar and wind energy, it meets the demands for eco-friendly and energy-efficient technological solutions of the future. Through remote sensing, the robot can identify the presence of cyanobacteria and precisely navigate to high concentrations areas, improving operational efficiency. At night, it autonomously returns to its recovery station addressing the inefficiency of recovery processes of existing surface-cleaning equipment.
