Cycling safety remains a major challenge for the hearing impaired, limiting their ability to detect critical auditory cues such as horns, sirens, and approaching and overtaking vehicles. Lumya addresses the absence of accessible safety devices tailored to hearing impaired needs by delivering real-time visual and haptic alerts, thus ensuring environmental awareness while cycling. Integrating a display, wristbands, a Lidar sensor, and microphones, the system detects potential hazards – empowering users to safely engage in an activity they currently can’t or are too afraid to experience.
