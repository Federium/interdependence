VirtX introduces a haptic interface product ecosystem consisting of two components: a Virtual Haptic Somatosensory Clothing and a Tac Haptic Interface Module. The first component enables high-precision, full-body virtual haptic rendering. The Somatosensory Clothing is composed of two parts: the clothing main body and the driving hardware. It can be connected to VR headsets and other extended reality devices, providing interactions beyond visual experiences, with a haptic resolution of up to 1mm. The product has broad practical value in fields such as experience, gaming, and medical applications. The second component can be understood as a plug-and-play "haptic screen," designed to be developer/designer-friendly. When connected to a computer and paired with module software and hardware for debugging, it can easily develop various virtual haptic patterns.
