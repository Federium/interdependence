Partito del Pomodoro, or PdP, is a nationalist party that idolizes the tomato as a symbol of Italian cuisine and tradition, with the goal of promoting exploitation. Led by the charismatic tomato-leader Pomì, the PdP spreads its ideology through the R.O.S.S.A., a device that allows its supporters, known as “pummaroli,” to visualize the changes the party seeks to implement. Through irony, Partito del Pomodoro wants to serve as a powerful tool to oppose the status quo and signal dissent by highlighting the absurdity of certain ideologies.
