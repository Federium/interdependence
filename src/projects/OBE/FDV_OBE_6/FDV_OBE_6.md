Courage is ABSURD explores the paradox of courage as both heroic and self-destructive. In the traditional view of courage, it is a virtue and its risks are rarely questioned. The installation challenges these norms, prompting reflection on the fine line between bravery and blind adherence to heroic ideals. Users must decide whether to walk under the hovering stones, facing perceived danger. Avoiding the risk aligns with self-preservation, while crossing symbolizes defiance of rational fear. This experience invites contemplation on courage as both a noble act and an absurd impulse.
