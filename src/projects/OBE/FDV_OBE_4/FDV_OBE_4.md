Chic, but Make It Kitsch defies fashionâ€™s rigid disparities, offering an inclusive, bold alternative for all. The project reimagines the twin set, once a symbol of privilege and exclusivity, in such a way that blurs the line between elitism and personal expression. Through the playful language of kitsch, the garment was turned into a vibrant, free and expressive piece, breaking away from imposed notions of elegance. Color and contrast choices contribute to challenging traditional aesthetics and make the twin set accessible to new, democratic forms of beauty.
