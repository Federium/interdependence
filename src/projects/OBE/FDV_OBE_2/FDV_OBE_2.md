Wheele is a UX design project sparked by Model 5Ã•s concept car, redefining digital interaction in autonomous car-sharing. It choreographs seamless experiences across public (in-car screens) and private (personal mobile) interfaces, enabling inclusive, smart urban mobility. By merging personal devices with shared screens, Wheele enhances both individual control and collective accessibility, creating a fluid, user-centered experience that adapts to diverse needs in the evolving landscape of transportation.
