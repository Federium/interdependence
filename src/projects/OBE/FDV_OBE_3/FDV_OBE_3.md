Can absurdist chatbots change how we design AI? Inspired by the surrealist philosophy of pataphysics, this project uses absurdist, critical design to question AI solutionism, specifically trustworthy AI. Three travel chatbots were developed, each addressing core requirements of trustworthy AI—transparency, human control, or fairness. By exaggerating the mechanisms behind these assumed requirements, users are prompted to critically reflect on the pursuit of trustworthy AI. In doing so, the project disobeys the prevailing view of AI as a catch-all solution, creating space to rethink the way we should design AI.
