The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence has fuelled the spread of deepfakes and misinformation in the digital age, eroding trust and distorting reality. This project introduces ÔArtificial Alerts,Õ a solution to expose the risks of digital deception and highlight the need for transparency. Through a visual campaign and innovative metadata UI concept, the project raises awareness of AI-driven misinformation, empowering audiences to navigate the digital world confidently while exploring how design can rebuild trust between artificial systems and natural human perception
