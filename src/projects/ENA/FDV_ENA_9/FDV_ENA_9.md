In an environment where access to information or data is increasingly easy, there are new challenges in finding quality information that is of interest to us. Today, the amount of information we have access to exceeds our capacity to absorb it, and our personal interest is what helps us keep abreast of this information, filtering it down to what is important to retain. Information is a driving force in the evolution of knowledge, which is why it is important to understand mechanisms that qualify its consumption. Against this backdrop, Sentimental Information arose an interest in the expressive register, and how it can be present in information design cohabiting with a technical dimension. Expression is also intrinsically present in design and offers clues for reflection on the challenges of information overload and interest.
