This project addresses the need for holistic, tangible tools that help children with ADHD establish and maintain routines while enabling caregivers to monitor and adjust treatment strategies effectively. The Cove system comprises three interconnected components: a physical routine planner with activity pebbles, a wearable reminder device, and an app, which work together to empower neurodivergent children by providing a structured framework that helps them manage their routines, regulate their emotions, simplify tracking and deal with daily activities, while also enhancing communication among parents, teachers, and therapists.
