OstoKit addresses the lack of aesthetics in colostomy devices with a personalized, reusable patch and a 3D-scan subscription service. Prioritizing comfort, customization, and responsible consumption, it reduces stigmatization while enhancing user experience, inclusivity and disability pride, especially in sexual and fitness contexts.
