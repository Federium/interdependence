The Balancê walking support was created for elders who seek a more elegant and personalized alternative to traditional canes, which often fail to represent their identity. By integrating biomimicry and emotional design, it offers a natural, balanced gait while breaking the stigma associated with mobility aids. The project reimagines assistive devices as tools for dignity and self-expression, harmonizing practicality and individuality, redefining the relationship between users and the objects they rely on.
