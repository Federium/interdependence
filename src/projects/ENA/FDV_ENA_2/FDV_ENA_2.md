PAWS-ABILITY tackles the challenge of creating an affordable, sustainable, and smart dog prosthetic to optimize post-surgical recovery, simplify production, and support owners facing new responsibilities and emotions. Using AI, an app scans the pet, generates a CAD model, and employs additive manufacturing for a tailored prosthetic, while a vital sensor provides live health feedback, aiding decision-making and recovery. Sustainability is ensured with recyclable materials, replaceable parts, and reduced CO2 emissions through streamlined processes and minimized transportation.
