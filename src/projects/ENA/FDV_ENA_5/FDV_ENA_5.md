Raižplēsis is a website with simple, easy-to-understand content designed for kids of different ages and abilities. It was born out of the intent to help children feel less scared about medical procedures while involving parents in the process. Through fun stories, games, and a friendly character, it helps children learn about medicine in a way that feels safe and playful. Parents are part of the journey too, making it a shared experience that brings comfort and understanding to families facing medical challenges.
