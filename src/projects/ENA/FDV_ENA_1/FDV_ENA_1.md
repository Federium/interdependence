Space for Others is an interdisciplinary design research studio studying the dynamics of co-creating spaces, balancing individual agency and collective collaboration. The project uses aggregate building systems and intuitive assembly grammars to explore this dichotomy. Through computational modeling, digital fabrication, and participatory play scenarios, the studio developed toy-scale 3D printed prototypes for collaborative studies. These experiments informed a full-scale kit, now tested in public play workshops to refine approaches to inclusivity, accessibility, and shared authorship.
