Designed for younger generations who enjoy good food but lack time or space, Simmi is a kitchen mixer that simplifies long cooking tasks while preserving the essence of traditional cooking. Collaborating with AI to automate time-consuming processes, it allows users to focus on creativity and connection with food, redefining the boundary between manual and automated cooking and ultimately enhancing both the process and outcome.
