Waterquake is a first aid kit designed to help rescuers deliver water to earthquake victims trapped under rubble. As dehydration and crush syndrome are the primary causes of death in such situations, the kit ensures an intuitive, immediate water supply, addressing critical survival needs. It is tailored for targeted but increasingly frequent emergencies, from urban centers to periphery.
