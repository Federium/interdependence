Commonplace, a non-profit center for tactical urbanism, resists capitalist frameworks by amplifying the contributions of laborers whose efforts sustain from the boundaries. Using disobedient guerrilla tactics, it defines the urban interior as a collective commons. Materialist culture, driven by relentless innovation, places the 1% at the center, relegating the 99% to the boundary. Commonplace urges a shift from obedient self-interest to common interest, advocating for participation, agency, and acts of resistance to catalyze a care movement.
