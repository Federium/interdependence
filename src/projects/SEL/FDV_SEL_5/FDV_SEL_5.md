The Civic Playground Project is a speculative research initiative centered on “civic toys”: manipulable, community-oriented 3D objects that encourage collaborative creativity and problem-solving. The first iteration aims to enable individuals from diverse backgrounds, skills, and abilities to engage in shared making while easing tensions inherent in collaborative processes. By balancing individual contributions with collective configurations, civic toys provide inclusive frameworks that foster imaginative exploration, cooperative interaction, and participatory expression.
