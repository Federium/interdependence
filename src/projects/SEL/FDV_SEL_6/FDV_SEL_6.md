Language is not defined by a set of rules. The expression “distortion of language” loses its meaning, because language is alive, metaphorical and fragile, it can react quickly to environmental changes and becoming the best means of communication. Nonetheless, the lack of a common understanding of language can lead to a feeling of alienation and disconnection. Within this context, Slänger started out of a desire to clarify slang, but also to effectively introduce it to a larger audience. To achieve this goal, it introduces modern Estonian slang in a calendar format that promotes learning new words – one word a week and space to reflect. The form of the calendar removes the formalities of a classic dictionary and provides visual support for the humour and playfulness of slang. Without diving deep into the history, rules nor definitions, Slänger encourages us to communicate through finding common ground.
