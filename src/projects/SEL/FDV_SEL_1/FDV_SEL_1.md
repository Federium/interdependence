Apu's Save the Penguin toy demonstrates the power of design to address urgent global challenges, such as climate change, by engaging the next generation through the universal language of play. By focusing on children, it fosters the development of the next generation of climate and environmental stewards, cultivating empathy, curiosity, and confidence to imagine and create a more sustainable future. Design brings a greater purpose to play in a playful way, ensuring that even the smallest hands can help shape a healthier planet.
