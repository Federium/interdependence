Diverso da Zero redesigns the square of Pieve del Cairo (Pavia) starting from an extraordinary event: a “splinter rain” that transformed the space. The disturbance created by the splinter rain became the starting point for creating dynamic and innovative spaces. Using sustainable materials such as rice waste fabric and rice fiber, environments that stimulate sociality and interaction were designed. New spatial functions, including play areas, art academies and community areas, turn the square into a unique space where citizens can live engaging experiences.
