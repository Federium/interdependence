In jewelry design, engineering drawings are used to measure inlays and create mounting frames based on these measurements. The question arises: does this measurement process itself constitute the inlaying? I used stainless steel frame made through the forms of engineering drawing to inlay various dried fruits, exploring whether the technical language in this scientific context has inherent characteristics, like metal, rather than being a neutral, self-evident discourse. Are the measurement results perfectly accurate, or are they subjective assumptions, hard to fully define?
