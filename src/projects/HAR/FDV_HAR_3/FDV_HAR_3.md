Re-Viewing the Gaze challenges the polarized constructions of gender and identity, by critiquing expected societal norms and biases. Employing an interactive exhibition design, the cognitive tension between opposing worldviews is explored. This provokes viewers to rethink their rigid expectations, through facilitated visual and narrative means. The project asks viewers to actively shift their gaze, revealing the cognitive dissonance which would usually blind them to alternative thought.
