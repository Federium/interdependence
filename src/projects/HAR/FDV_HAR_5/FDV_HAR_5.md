With the imminent end of skiing, the mountains are being transformed into a journey through time. Vestiges reinvents these snowless landscapes by transforming the remnants of the 60s into an immersive adventure. Hikers will discover a new way of experiencing the mountains, combining simplicity and sobriety. This unique itinerary, far removed from conventional “hotel” refuges, introduces beginners to the wonders of nature and teaches them to respect the environment. It’s a new way of rediscovering the mountains, where every step tells a story and every view inspires.
