Commonplace, a non-profit center for tactical urbanism, aims at resisting capitalist frameworks by amplifying the contributions of laborers whose efforts sustain from the boundaries. Using disobedient guerrilla tactics, it defines the urban interior as a collective common. Materialist culture, driven by relentless innovation, places the 1% at the center, relegating the 99% to the boundary. Commonplace urges a shift from self-interest to common interest, advocating for participation, agency, and acts of resistance to catalyze a care movement.
