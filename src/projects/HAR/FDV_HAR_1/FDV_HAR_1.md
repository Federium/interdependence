CVm2 is a project continually shaped by contrasts, starting from the relationship between historical heritage and its role today, the clash of foreign memories and new experiences, and the tension between construction and destruction. The project focuses on repurposing the remnants of buildings bombed in 1944 consisting essentially exterior walls, one made of dolomite and the other of red brick, that were adapted for economic use in the post-war period, according to available resources. The sheds have now outlived their purpose, and the time has come to restore one of them to a residential function, while the other is to be introduced to that role. The study of construction materials, clay and dolomite, evolved into two interior concepts: Clay and Dolomite. The Clay plans to restore the shed’s residential function by creating two 34.5 m² rental apartments, while the Dolomite building will host a “holiday home” for families, with four levels for four people, resulting in s a space where communal living coexists with individual autonomy.
