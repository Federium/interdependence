Amputees are often excluded and isolated due to bodily limitations and societal stigma. Prostheses can help them to live more independent, healthy and active lives and lets them be part of the society with lesser limitations. However, access to these devices is extremely limited, and even when they are accessible, prostheses are often NOt accepted. The industry today focuses on high-tech products, while simpler, more affordable solutions are being mostly neglected. In this project, I tried finding ways to improve accessibility, functionality and acceptance. I did this in close collaboration with users, stakeholders and my collaborating partner Agile Robots. The final concept combines advantages of both electric and mechanical prostheses in a low-cost, open source design. It allows for ergoNOmical, functional and aesthetic customization based on the usersÕ individual needs and desires. This process is facilitated by leveraging techNOlogies such as 3D-printing to reduce cost and manual work effort.
