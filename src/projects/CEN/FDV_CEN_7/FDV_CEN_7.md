On-demand 3D printing enables quick responses to local needs, promoting local production to address specific issues. Tete Ya Mama was born from the desire to use 3D printing to solve real-world problems, particularly in less developed contexts and emerging countries. The identified opportunity was addressing congenital malformations, specifically cleft palates, a condition that hinders breastfeeding and can cause malnutrition, particularly in African countries. This led to the creation of Tete Ya Mama, a 3D printed device that facilitates breastfeeding, making it safer and more effective. The device is digitally modeled and printed as needed, ensuring resource access to everyone in need and demonstrating how innovation can address major global challenges starting from a more specific topic or need.
