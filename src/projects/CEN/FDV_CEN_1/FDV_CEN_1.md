Liquo is a syringe with an integrated filter for water activated vaccines, aiming to improve vaccination access in the periphery. Unequal distribution of resources creates centers of abundance and peripheries of scarcity. The strict cold chain required for some vaccines contributes to the deepening of geographical inequalities. Freeze-dried vaccines that can be activated with water at the time and location of use help bridge that gap. The Liquo-syringe was born as an assignment to create a user-powered water filter that could be used in any kind of environment.
