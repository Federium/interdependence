A syringe with an integrated filter for water activated vaccines √ê improving vaccination access in the periphery. Unequal distribution of resources creates centers of abundance and peripheries of scarcity. The strict cold chain needed for some vaccines produces a need that contributes to the geographical inequalities. Freeze-dried vaccines that can be activated with water at the time and location of use help bridge that gap. The Liquo-syringe was born as an assignment to create a user-powered water filter in an Industrial Manufacturing course as part of a Design BA in Aalto University in 2024.
