subtitle: "This project is a practical design challenge on the theme of exclusion and inclusion. In particular, in graduation research, which tends to remain in an academic setting, this project tackled the theme of exclusion and inclusion in a more practical way by collaborating with people who are actually facing the issue in Japan. Three students each approached a different problem in Japan."

Speculative Design Study for Future ÒLife-AfterlifeÓ
In contemporary Japan, technology and views of life and death have become incompatible.
In addition, with the development of generative AI technology, it is beginning to happen that the dead can be brought back to life by technology, regardless of their will. The majority of the living no longer have rights over the dead, and society is heading toward dystopia.
 Therefore, using speculative design, we speculated on a desirable life-afterlife for the future formation of an AI society.
 As a scenario, we set up a future society in which unwanted resurrections occur, and created a dystopian image of the dead in an elevator.To avoid this, we proposed ÒA-Life,Ó a platform for realizing a better life-afterlife. We produced a device for both the dead and the living to meet face to face in the way they desire.
 Based on these proposals, workshops were held for citizens at the temple. Speculation about the future was conducted, and sympathy for the activities of ÒA-LifeÓ by the priests was obtained.
