Integral Conductive Fabric proposes the creation of knit materials using conductive threads to integrate fashion and technology. Conventionally, such garments struggle to merge fabric and mechanical components, affecting both appearance and comfort. By knitting conductive threads into fabric, the design blends electrical functionality with textile material. These threads can function as circuits or sensors. As circuits, they power LEDs when fabrics overlap, or the garment is fastened. As sensors, they light up LEDs upon skin contact, reflecting human interactions with clothing in its design.
