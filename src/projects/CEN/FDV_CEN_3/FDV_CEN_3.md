Developed to support rural Ugandan villages during flood emergencies, WIMBE is a product-service system designed to address the urgent challenge of protecting communities from devastating floods. In a world where climate emergencies deepen social inequalities, WIMBE provides villagers with survival vests essential for safely fleeing inundated areas. Beyond the vest, WIMBE offers critical information on optimal escape routes and educates about post-disaster housing security. Emphasizing inclusivity, the project ensures vulnerable populations, who often lack access to adequate support during climate crises, are equipped and empowered to respond effectively.
