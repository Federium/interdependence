Sight is an extremely important element for learning and development&#59 thus it is crucial that children have eye examinations to detect any problems. Vision Crafters seeks to prevent and address visual impairments through an inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly experience. By combining hands-on activities with affordable materials, it transforms visual education into a playful and enriching journey. Vision Crafters is a DIY glasses kit paired with an app, designed to help low-income families determine if their children may need support or be at risk for visual impairment. The experience is built around an interactive and engaging learning approach that empowers users with knowledge and awareness. Being more than just a toy, but a way to ‘see’ disability as a resource and not as a limitation to society, it ensures that awareness and knowledge are not the preserve of a few but an opportunity for all.
