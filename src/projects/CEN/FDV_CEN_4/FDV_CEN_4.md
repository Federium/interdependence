The village of Asni is situated along an epistemological boundary where the notion of centrality contrasts with the fluidity of the border. The earthquake of September 2023 intensified the deep tension between permanence and change, between rootedness in memory and the need to redefine its future. In this context, the project of redesigning an applicable settlement model takes shape as an act of deconstruction and redefinition of spatial meaning, where the center dissolves into the fractures of the crisis, and the border emerges as a space of rewriting, where informal dwelling assumes new forms and functions, becoming a plural point of reference.
