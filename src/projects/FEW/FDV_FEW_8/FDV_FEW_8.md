Passepartout explores the tension between exclusivity and inclusivity in the context of art museums. It tackles the challenge of unequal access to cultural content and expression particularly looking at the inaccessibility faced by visually impaired individuals. Through a system that integrates human verification and advanced AI tools, the project provides consistent and coherent artwork descriptions, bridging access gaps and allowing independent visits for visually impaired individuals. This innovative approach fosters a more inclusive museum experience, ensuring that all visitors, regardless of ability, can engage with art in meaningful ways.
