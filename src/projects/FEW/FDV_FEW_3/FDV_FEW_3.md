CREAJOR is an interactive design tailored to the drawing and reading habits of visually impaired students. Students can perceive images by touching a display screen with raised dots, supplemented by shortcut keys with voice prompts. These features cater to visually impaired people’s reliance on touch and hearing. Moreover, it includes an option to facilitate writing as well. To enable visually impaired students to draw freely, a user-friendly design, equipped with functional buttons aid in drawing and annotating with ease and precision. The CREAJOR pen utilizes an optical translation measurement sensor, allowing it to draw on any flat surface. The results are displayed in real-time on the dot matrix display screen, breaking spatial limitations and providing an enhanced drawing experience. A numeric keypad quantifies line lengths for precise drawing, while the pen’s unique triangular shape prevents it from rolling away. Additionally, its magnetic feature ensures the pen is always secure and within reach.
