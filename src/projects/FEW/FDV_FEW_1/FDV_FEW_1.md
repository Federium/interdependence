The Enclave is meant for the non-human residents of Warsaw. It's existence is made possible through bottom-up citizen initiatives and it's construction does not require expertise in building or design. The clay composite enters into a relation with local organisms and is in turn shaped by them and the environment - the resultant cracks and crevices can be colonized by plants and invertebrates, the top of the structure can be a place for birds to rest and feed. The project is a space in which the work of humans can be given over to non-humans, and the city | nature dichotomy can be blurred.
