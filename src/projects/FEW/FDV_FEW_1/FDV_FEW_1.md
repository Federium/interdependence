The Sensory Jewelry project is a response to the needs and adaptation mechanisms of neurodivergent people. It aims to provide a safe and discreet tool that supports emotional regulation for people with impaired sensory integration. Although society is becoming more compassionate towards individuals who go beyond broadly understood social norms, stigmatization is still a significant issue. Inclusive design is crucial not only to improving the lives of the few, but also sensitizing others to the challenges they face, allowing for society to reconnect and create a better environment for all.
