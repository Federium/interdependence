The Balanc walking support was created for elderly individuals who seek a more elegant and personalized alternative to traditional canes, which often fail to represent their identity. By integrating biomimicry and emotional design, it offers a natural, balanced gait while breaking the stigma associated with mobility aids. The project reimagines assistive devices as tools for dignity and self-expression.
Under the theme "Interdependence - Exploring Opposites" and the subtheme Enabling/Relieving, Balanc explores how design can empower users by supporting their mobility needs while reducing the physical and emotional burden of traditional aids. It harmonizes practicality and individuality, redefining the relationship between users and the objects they rely on.
