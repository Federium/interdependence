Raranga is an educational gamified toolkit developed to equip kaimahi (employees) with the skills and knowledge to assist them as on their Tangata Tiriti (treaty partnership) journeys with the ultimate goal of improving Māori workplace satisfaction for better systemic outcomes. The kēmu (game) centers learning through collaboration, reflecting the traditional Māori art of Raranga (weaving). The practice weaves together individual strands of harakeke to create something stronger, symbolising the collective journey towards understanding and embodying Te Tiriti. Raranga breaks down the hierarchical power dynamics that exist within workplaces, creating a safe environment for collaboration and knowledge sharing.
