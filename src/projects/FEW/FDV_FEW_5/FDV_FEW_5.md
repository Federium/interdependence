Mole consists of a kitchenware collection that combines functionality and aesthetic simplicity, reflecting contrasting ideas of exclusivity and accessibility. The design highlights the balance between personal, human-scale usability and broader considerations of sustainability and shared use. With minimalist forms, natural materials, and versatile finishes, the collection invites reflection on how objects can serve both individual needs and collective aspirations, blending elegance with practicality for everyday living.
