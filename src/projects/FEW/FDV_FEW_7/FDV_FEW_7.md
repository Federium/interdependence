Redefining Limits is a pavilion designed to encourage a reflection on the evolution of perceptions surrounding disability and social inclusion, particularly influenced by events like the Paralympic Games. While the journey toward full inclusion is ongoing, the pavilion emphasizes its importance. Designed to be inclusive and accessible, it features tactile paths for the visually impaired, ensuring a comprehensive experience for all. With three distinct entrances, the pavilion invites visitors to explore the theme of disability from various perspectives, offering a space for reflection and dialogue.
