Decision-making for the Energy Transition explores the emerging socio-technological characteristics of a hybrid system and how community decision-making might be informed by HACID technology.  Created with project partner NESTA and their Collective Intelligence design team, the project identifies the gap between individual and collective to inform not only the way decisions around energy might be made and its relationships with people locally, but also who is making these decisions and the role of policy makers in the future.
