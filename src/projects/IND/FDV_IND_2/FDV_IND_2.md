Western Europe has three times the global average of children in care, and many of them cannot choose their belongings. Echoes of Us involves 6 upcycled wooden pieces that children can customize and assemble into a transportable box, reflecting their individuality. The pieces can also be reconfigured into a shared, abstract structure, promoting creativity and collaboration. Personal and collective elements are interconnected, encouraging both self-expression as well as the act of coming together as a community.
