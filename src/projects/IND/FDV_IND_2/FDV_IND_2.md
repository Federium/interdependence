The Problem:_ The decline of insect pollinators in urban areas is a growing global issue. Rapid urbanization and large-scale agriculture reduce food sources and nesting areas, threatening wild insects. Yet, humans depend on biodiversity for clean air, water, and food.

What the project is about:_ Cities can support insects by creating wildlife areas within their boundaries. This project promotes urban biodiversity through educational DIY toolkits for nesting sites. This Ôground unitÕ was developed at KTU Design Centre, within the Product Design course.
