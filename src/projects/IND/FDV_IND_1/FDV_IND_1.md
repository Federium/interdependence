Biotechnological processes and body-hacking have evolved. NOw, individuals customise their physiology to meet their specific needs.

The Autograft Runners are designed to push the athletic boundaries of long-distance running. This footwear is crafted through tissue engineering and utilises the wearerÕs own biomaterials to enhance the feet for long runs. It is the tool of choice for elite athletes who temporarily hack their bodies to optimise them specifically for their races. Ð (ARTIFICIAL / NATURAL + ENABLING / RELIEVING)
