Designed with the goal of giving back the street to those without cars, NightS is a smart jacket for nighttime e-scooter riders. Born from a future vision where e-clothing promotes sustainability and circularity while enhancing human-embodied experiences, NightS incorporates smart technologies to improve the nighttime riding experience. It enhances visibility through reflective materials, improves urban mobility safety with strategically placed padding, and integrates sensors for fall detection. Using Arduino, 3D printing, and laser cutting for production, the design minimizes waste and ensures recyclability by enabling the disassembly of both the technological components and the jacket itself.
