"Trame d'attesa emerged from a reflection on the future of mobility and its emotional and psychological impact. In an increasingly fast-paced world, where technological advancements aim to eliminate inefficiencies, moments of waiting remain one of the few constants we cannot escape. Despite ongoing efforts to optimize transportation and reduce travel times, we are often confronted with delays, missed connections, and unavoidable pauses. From this realization, the Trame d'attesa podcast was born. This innovative format explores new ways of ""looking at time passing by."" Through everyday stories and the intimate reflections of the storyteller, listeners are invited to explore new approaches to interacting with suspended time, encouraging a shift toward more positive perceptions of these often-overlooked moments."
