Living Tomorrow addresses the French student's housing challenges of high rent, inadequate or sub-standards living conditions, and limited mobility. Proposing a resilient and inclusive solution balancing accessibility with personal and collective well-being, the design includes individual spaces optimized for rest and work activities, and collective spaces fostering community coexistence (kitchens, coworking, relaxation). The modular homes are adaptable, designed for rehabilitation or reversible housing on unused land, supporting flexibility and sustainability through collaborative development.
