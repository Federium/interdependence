In a digitally driven world, Pulmonaut explores breathing as a technology and universal language of connection. Merging scientific glassblowing in a contemporary fashion context, flexible glass sculptures visualize the spiritual essence of mindful breathing and movement. Flowing with fire while feeling through breath, glass embodies a symphony of surgical craftsmanship. Co-created with master craftsman Günther Mausz, this project highlights the power of multidisciplinary collaboration, amplifying craftsmanship as an art of our future and breathing as a technology of our present.
