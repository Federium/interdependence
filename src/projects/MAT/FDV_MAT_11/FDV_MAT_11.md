In Japan, the number of people suffering from mental illness is increasing every year. Self-negation is one of the reasons of mental illness, affecting particularly, those in the “gray zone of developmental disorders”. YORIGOKORO serves as a platform to prepare a better place for one's mind, where self-negation can be handled. Physically, YORIGOKORO presents as a coffer where people can store items that will serve as a source of emotional comfort, when the mind is too tired to move. It also provides a sense of security, telling users that their item “is here, so I'll be okay” even when not in use. YORIGOKORO materializes the sense of security and comfort through “safe objects” and the ritual action of opening and closing the box, which encourages a change of mindset in the user.
