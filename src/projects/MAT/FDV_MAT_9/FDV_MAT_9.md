This project explores the role of a sacred space in a big cityâ€™s life, like that of Milano. In a reality where sacred seems completely detached to daily, music is the answer to this inclusion problem: the sound of a choir or prayers immediately reminds us about the numinous and can be recognizable by everyone, even from a busy street and even from a mass underground. The sacred space, represented by church of San Sepolcro in Milan, presents an underground level, where three different devices hide the pipe organ, the choir and the prayer sound, that spread through the upper level, and a little square, where everyone can interact with the church, bringing the spiritual element of this project to everyone in their daily lives.
