Amid the relentless pace of urban life, Living in the Pause offers a haven of tranquillity in the heart of Lomellina’s rural landscape. It invites visitors to pause, breathe, and reconnect with nature while discovering the region’s rich agricultural heritage. Partnerships with small family-run food businesses and local musicians enhance the experience, bringing Lomellina’s unique flavours and creative spirit to life. At its core, it fosters an environment where people and nature coexist harmoniously. It’s not just a retreat but a holistic experience that nurtures the body, mind, and soul.
