The project introduces a haptic interface product ecosystem called VirtX, which primarily consists of two systems:
A. VirtX Virtual Haptic Somatosensory Clothing
This system enables high-precision full-body virtual haptic rendering. The product is divided into two parts: the clothing main body and the driving hardware. It can be adapted to VR headsets and other extended reality devices, providing virtual reality interactions that go beyond visual experiences, with a haptic resolution of up to 1mm. The product has broad practical value in fields such as experience, gaming, and medical applications.
B. VirtX-Tac Haptic Interface Module
This can be understood as a plug-and-play "haptic screen," designed to be developer/designer-friendly. Once connected to a computer and paired with module software and hardware for debugging, it can easily develop various virtual haptic patterns. The techNOlogy is based on shift register architecture and is connected through five-channel serial interface to form a standardized interface. It has great significance in the transition from techNOlogy to commercial product.
