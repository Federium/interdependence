"Burial Shrouds focuses on the principles of making, learning, noticing, and caring through reflective weaving and design practice. In a world facing crisis, biodiversity loss and despair it reflects on our relationship with creativity and spiritual fulfilment, creating multi-dimensional woven pieces from hemp and linen that are tactile, dynamic, and interactive, designed to be touched and explored. Burial Shrouds examines creativity through the lens of grief following an unexpected death, juxtaposing intangible spiritual emotions with tangible, material expressions of loss and remembrance."
