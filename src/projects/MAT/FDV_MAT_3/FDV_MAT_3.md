A Second Purpose is a collaborative international project that explores design interventions for repurposing discarded objects. Vessels from household waste were selected and additive components to transform them into functional, desirable products for displaying flowers were designed and developed. The components, produced using 3D printing, were designed for the giftware market, focusing on sustainability, consumer ownership, creating nostalgic connections and breathing new life into seemingly obsolete objects.
