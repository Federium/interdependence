CHALLENGE:
Our challenge was to design something that could help children with disabilities in their development and growth phase, but at the same time be playful, accessible and educational. The mission of our project is therefore to improve conditions for visually impaired children in families with economic difficulties. Sight is an extremely important element for learning and development, in fact it is very important that children have eye examinations to detect any problems. But why not make this more fun, affordable and accessible? 

PROJECT EXPLANATION: 
Vision Crafters is a DIY glasses kit paired with an app, designed to help low-income families determine if their children may need support or be at risk for visual impairment. The experience is built around an interactive and engaging learning approach that empowers users with knowledge and awareness. Guided by the FOR-FEW / FOR-ALL principle, Vision Crafters seeks to prevent and address visual impairments through an inclusive, accessible, and user-friendly experience. By combining hands-on activities with affordable materials, Vision Crafters transforms visual education into a playful and enriching journey. More than just a toy, but a way to ÔseeÕ disability as a resource and not as a limitation to society, ensuring that awareness and knowledge are not the preserve of a few but an opportunity for all.
