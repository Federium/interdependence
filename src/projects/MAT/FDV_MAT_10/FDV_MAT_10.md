GRAVITAS explores the act of designing a sacred space and what it means to work with codes that deal with a material reality flanked by another dimension that corroborates it and constitutes its essence. Empties and fullnesses alternate, to create pauses and tensions typical of an architecture that identifies suspension and interlocking as the morphological tools of a semantics of contemplation, characteristic of places dedicated to thought and prayer. Depriving the architectural material of its gravity and heaviness and maintaining its being the substance of hoped-for things, the project becomes the graphic link between the earthly tectonic experience and another place of which the experience of architecture attempts to represent its ethereal essence
