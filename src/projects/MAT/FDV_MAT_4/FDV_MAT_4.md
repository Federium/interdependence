Investigation# explores whether in the context of jewelry design, the technical language of engineering drawings, used to measure inlays and create mounting frames, has inherent characteristics, rather than being a neutral, self-evident discourse. In its exploration the project employs steel frames made through the forms of engineering drawing to inlay various dried fruits, questioning whether the measurement results are perfectly accurate, or are they subjective assumptions, hard to fully define. Investigation# seeks for references in the relationships between theoretical measurements and their material application, their meaning and their presence, their implications and their evidence.
