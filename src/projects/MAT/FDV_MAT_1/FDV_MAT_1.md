How might we facilitate kaimahi (employees) on their tangata tiriti (treaty partnership) journeys in order to improve M_ori workplace satisfaction for better systemic outcomes?"
Raranga is an educational gamified toolkit developed to equip kaimahi with the skills and kNOwledge to assist them as Tangata Tiriti. The k_mu (game) centres learning through collaboration, reflecting the traditional M_ori art of Raranga (weaving). The practice weaves together individual strands of harakeke to create something stronger, symbolising the collective journey towards understanding and embodying Te Tiriti. 

Raranga breaks down the hierarchical power dynamics that exist within workplaces, creating a safe environment for collaboration and kNOwledge sharing.
