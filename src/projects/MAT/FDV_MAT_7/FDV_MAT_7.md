Single-use plastic pallet wrap is used widely in the transportation industry for convenience and efficiency, and accounts for 1.5% of global plastic waste. Transparent Paths reimagines the value of waste pallet wrap, repurposing it into strong, luminous yarn to be woven. Engaging with waste material through the meditative act of weaving a reflective practice is fostered, promoting both spiritual well-being and sustainability in a world shaped by overconsumption. The woven textiles reframe waste as a valuable resource for reuse.
