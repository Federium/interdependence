MyOceanEye is a DIY floating camera that captures underwater images and live-streams them to your phone. Your photos help train the AI to recognize marine life and debris, turning your exploration into valuable data for ocean scientists and ocean cleanup projects. The cameraÕs simple design means anyone Ð from families to schools - can assemble it using everyday items like a Raspberry Pi, a fisheye camera, and a waterproof container. MyOceanEye combines techNOlogy (AI, Raspberry Pi) with nature (ocean) to enhance human understanding of marine ecosystems. This interplay demonstrates how artificial tools can coexist with and support natural systems.
