"Based on the exploratory construction scenario of the Tencent â€œQi'e Island Future City"" project, Symbiotic Link focuses on soilless green plant cultivation and sustainable development in smart communities.By combining environmental science with social co-creation, Symbiotic Link leverages microalgae with efficient oxygen production performance as its core carrier, while also serving a green plant installation with viewing, resting, and social functions. Overall it is a systems of three elements: a spiritual cultivation algae bioreactor, an air purification system, and a visual air quality monitoring system, based on a simple to assemble structure that can adapt to different environments."
