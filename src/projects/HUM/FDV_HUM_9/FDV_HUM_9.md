Squeak is a product designed for rabbits rather than their human owners. Born out of the sentence “less for better”, Squeak is a product that allows anyone who owns a rabbit to integrate vitamins and fibers deriving from food waste (vegetable and fruit peelings) in their little friend’s diet. /n Squeak helps humans reducing food waste, while being an alternative kind of entertainment for rabbits, bringing together perks for both humans and their more than human pet friends.
