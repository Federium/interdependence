Coastal erosion is destroying homes all around Ireland. Communities struggle for coastal protection options that are attainable and respect biodiversity laws. Marram grass planting, a proven solution, has protected the town of the Maharees in the West of Ireland since 2016. Plánta provides the knowhow & community management capabilities of the Maharees community to all communities in Ireland, through programs that balance the needs of communities with biodiversity and regulation and allowing individuals to organize collective action for the betterment of both human, plant and animal life.
