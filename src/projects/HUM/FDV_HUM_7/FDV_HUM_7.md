HYGROW is a ceramic pot aiming at saving water and simplifying plant care. Designed to address water waste, air pollution and low sustainability awareness, HYGROW changes the way plants are watered by pouring water into the pot’s cavity rather than directly on the plant. The cavity contributes to creating a microclimate that mimics how plants naturally absorb water from the soil. <br>To enhance biophilia, low-maintenance plants studied by NASA to purify air from pollutants were identified as ideal for the product. Additionally an NFC tag interaction within the pot connects users to the website where they can learn about product’s benefits and access plant care tips.
