Bio-diverse Enclaves are spaces meant for the non-human residents of Warsaw. Its existence is made possible through bottom-up citizen initiatives and its construction does not require expertise in building or design. Made of a clay-composite, it enters into a relation with local organisms and is in turn shaped by them and the environment: the resultant cracks and crevices can be colonized by plants and invertebrates, the top of the structure can be a place for birds to rest and feed. The project is a space in which the work of humans can be given over to non-humans, and the dichotomy separating natural and artificial can be blurred.
