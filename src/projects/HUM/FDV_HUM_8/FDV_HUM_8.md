Excessive water hyacinth growth in swamps is the cause of ecosystems disruption as well as environmental and economic challenges. To address such issues, Hyac is a bio-based material from water hyacinth, transforming an ecological conflict into opportunity by repurposing invasive plants into resources. By curating landscapes and mitigating negative impacts, the projectâ€™s outcome is a regenerative cycle of biomaterials that fosters harmony, balances human needs, and promotes ecological care.
