Rhythmic Design for Aging Communities explores, through sound walking, the ever-changing sound environment of the Anshan community. Focusing particularly on the typical lifestyle of the elderly, it revealed their need for sound information during outdoor exercise activities. Based on the elderly's demand for structured activity patterns, a beat was identified as the key intervention point within the soundscape. To realize this concept, four physical sound devices, integrated with public fitness equipment, and three interactive sound devices were designed, establishing a prototype for a sports beat. To further harmonize the spatial soundscape, the project gathered sound materials from within the community. After rearranging and producing these sounds, they were used to create a unique sound for the “beat community,” designed to help the elderly establish exercise routines through sound, enhance fitness recovery, and draw attention to the specific hearing needs of this group.
