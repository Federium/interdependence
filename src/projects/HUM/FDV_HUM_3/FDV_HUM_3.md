This project is based on the role of a sacred space in a big city√ïs life (Milano). Music is the answer to this inclusion problem: the sound of a choir or prayers immediately reminds us about the nouminous and can be recognisable by everyone, even from a busy street and even tho the main mass is underground. The sacred space, in relation to the front church of San Sepolcro, has an underground level, where there are three different devices hiding the pipe organ, the choir and the prayer sound, that spread through the upper level, a little square, where everyone can interact with the church.
