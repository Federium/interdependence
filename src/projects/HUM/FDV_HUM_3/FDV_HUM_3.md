Biodivercities II wants to address a growing global issue: the decline of insect pollinators in urban areas. Rapid urbanization and large-scale agriculture reduce food sources and nesting areas, threatening wild insects. Nonetheless, humans depend on biodiversity for clean air, water, and food, and cities can support insects by creating wildlife areas within their boundaries. Biodivercities II promotes urban biodiversity through an educational DIY toolkits for nesting sites.
