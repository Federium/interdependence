        "description": "Performance in Italian and English. Beings do not precede relationships but are born together with them, mutually shaping one another in the infinite weaving of threads that tangle and give rise to worlds upon worlds. Some call it entanglement, but here, it’s just a game—you’re about to step inside. “Somewhere, Between” is a participatory audio-visual performance where audience and performers blur together, boundaries fade, and opposites reveal themselves to be inextricably intertwined in a co-becoming entanglement. The performance, produced by Campo Teatrale for the event INTERDEPENDENCE – Exploring Opposites 2025, is conceived and created by Usine Baug in collaboration with Pietro Francesco Pingitore (visual artist) and Matrix (New Media Artist – Interactive Sound & Visuals)."
