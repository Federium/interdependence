      "description": "Space for Others is an interdisciplinary design research studio studying the dynamics of co-creating spaces, balancing individual agency and collective collaboration. The project uses aggregate building systems and intuitive assembly grammars to explore this dichotomy. Through computational modeling, digital fabrication, and participatory play scenarios, the studio developed toy-scale 3D printed prototypes for collaborative studies. These experiments informed a full-scale kit, now tested in public play workshops to refine approaches to inclusivity, accessibility, and shared authorship.",

The kēmu (game) centres learning through collaboration, reflecting the traditional Māori art of Raranga (weaving). The practice weaves together individual strands of harakeke to create something stronger, symbolising the collective journey towards understanding and embodying Te Tiriti.

      "description": "Speculative Design Study for Future Life-Afterlife. In contemporary Japan, technology and views of life and death have become incompatible. In addition, with the development of generative AI technology, it is beginning to happen that the dead can be brought back to life by technology, regardless of their will. The majority of the living no longer have rights over the dead, and society is heading toward dystopia. Therefore, using speculative design, we speculated on a desirable life-afterlife for the future formation of an AI society. As a scenario, we set up a future society in which unwanted resurrections occur, and created a dystopian image of the dead in an elevator. To avoid this, we proposed A-Life, a platform for realizing a better life-afterlife. We produced a device for both the dead and the living to meet face to face in the way they desire. Based on these proposals, workshops were held for citizens at the temple. Speculation about the future was conducted, and sympathy for the activities of A-Life by the priests was obtained.",
